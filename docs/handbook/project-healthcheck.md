#Project Healthcheck

*Project Healthcheck* is our way of overseeing projects and ensuring we deliver projects as effectively as possible across the agency.

It was introduced in July 2016 and so we're still learning and optimising how it works. 
This is a trial approach - we’ll run it until September and then review to see if it’s fulfilling the purpose it’s designed for.

##What problems does *Project Healthcheck* solve?

1. We don’t have the right balance and type of project oversight and challenge at the moment - which we believe can lead to project delivery problems going un-noticed and unaddressed.
2. We aren’t maximising the advantage we have from organisational knowledge, talent and experience from across pods.

##The principles behind *Project Healthcheck*

1. This isn’t about top-down supervision or scrutiny - as the best knowledge and experience for project oversight and challenge is in our teams not in our leadership group. And we don’t want to create hierarchy unnecessarily to do this either.
2. We need to minimise dependence on any one individual to do this
3. It should be scalable for the next 6-12 months
4. It’s not about telling teams what to do differently - it’s about being a critical friend that helps pods reflect on their project decisions and decide what they need to change

##How it works

To create *Project Healthcheck* we’ve drawn heavily on Pixar’s concept that they call [Braintrust](http://www.fastcompany.com/3027135/lessons-learned/inside-the-pixar-braintrust). This is useful excerpt of an interview with a senior team member at Pixar about the value of Braintrust:

>“To understand why the Braintrust is so central to Pixar, you have to start with a basic truth: People who take on complicated creative projects become lost at some point in the process. It is the nature of things—in order to create, you must internalize and almost become the project for a while, and that near-fusing with the project is an essential part of its emergence. But it is also confusing. Where once a movie's writer/director had perspective, he or she loses it. Where once he or she could see a forest, now there are only trees.”

*Project Healthcheck* is our peer-led approach to project review and challenge. It’s about peers reviewing projects, making sure we’re using our collective expertise well, are following our processes and incorporating lessons learnt from previous projects.

*Project Healthcheck* is all about:
- Peer to peer review and challenge
- Candid and open at all times
- Advice and challenge, not direction

### Who is involved?
At any one time there are three members of the *Project Healthcheck* team - the two chapter leads (technical and creative) and an account manager. The MD may attend too in an advisory capacity. Chapter leads may nominate a member of their chapter to attend in their place.

The *Project Healthcheck* session is also attended by the entire pod working on a specific project.
When *Project Healthcheck* is reviewing a project, the members of the *Project Healthcheck* group can’t be involved in delivering the project - so it may be necessary to substitute a member of *Project Healthcheck* when this happens

### What happens?
*Project Healthcheck* happens when someone asks for it to happen. 

Anyone in a pod or on the leadership team can call a *Project Healthcheck* for a project anywhere in the agency.

The *Project Healthcheck* session lasts a maximum of one hour.

The findings and actions from the *Project Healthcheck* session are recorded in a Google Doc using a [standard template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VK_DqAr6ZV8tHDJiDogHrdW_aOSad83cLzeWk5QGupE/edit) and shared with the whole agency on the Slack #healthcheck channel.

The pod lead for the project is accountable for ensuring actions from *Project Healthcheck* are addressed.

Each project and context is different. However to make sure that each *Project Healthcheck* is done consistently, there are some specific questions that will be asked in each session:

- What are at least the top three things that could go wrong on this project? 
- What actions are we taking to stop these happening and minimise impact if they do? 
- Are those steps adequate?
- What's new about this project that we haven't done before?
- Where's the data/evidence that shows we're on track (or off track)?
- Which "do differently"s from previous project retrospectives are we putting into action on this project?
- Are we following our process as we should (discovery / production / optimisation)? Are there any things we're doing differently?
