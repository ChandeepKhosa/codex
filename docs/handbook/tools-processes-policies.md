#Tools, policies and processes

Pods should be free to do what they need to do to get the job done. 

That’s our primary aim, but in an agency we need to have some standard practices that hold us together, as well as the freedoms to work how we need to so that we can deliver great work for our clients.

Here’s a quick rundown of what’s a company-wide standard:

##Company-wide processes and policies

- EOS methods and tools
- Our delivery methodology - the three stage Discovery, Production and Optimisation approach
- The Deeson agile delivery methodology
- Estimating methodology
- Recruitment
- Goals and development
- Company business policies (HR, environmental etc)
- The Deeson Handbook
- Job roles and accountabilities

##Company-wide tools

- Discipline-specific software, tools and standards- eg development environments
- Reporting standards and tools - eg report cards
- Our time recording tool - Harvest
- Our forecasting tool - Forecast
- Business systems - Macs, Google Drive, email etc

If the company-wide standard tool or process isn’t working as well as you think it could or you think there’s a better way, get a guild together and recommend a better way for consideration.
