# Clear accountabilities

Accountability is vital in how we do things at Deeson.

Accountability is about being impeccable with your word - doing what you say and saying what you do. 

Accountability is all about making, keeping and answering for your personal and professional commitments.

There should be only one owner for all major responsibilities in the agency and everyone should understand who owns what. 

If everyone is responsible then ultimately no-one is responsible. 

There are three things that need to be in place to have long-term accountability in our agency:

- **Expectations** - we have to set clear expectations with and amongst teams
- **Buy-in** - team members must be involved in setting the expectations and agree that they are reasonable and achievable
- **Results** - team members need to understand the consequences of success or failure and how their accountability will directly affect the results

Itâ€™s important that everyone has clear accountabilities in their role and the handbook is designed to help with this. 

But ultimately it's every team member's responsibility to know, understand and be confident doing what it takes to fulfil their own accountabilities.
