There are two kinds of team at Deeson and everyone in a client-facing delivery role is part of each of these teams:

## Project team

This is small multi-disciplinary team that’s using the Deeson agile framework to deliver a project for a client. 

A team member may be a member of more than one project at once depending on the stage that a project is at.

We keep the number of projects that a team member is involved with to a minimum. The less projects someone is dealing with, the better we can focus and not lose efficiency through context switching

## Chapter team

The chapter is the professional group within the agency - for example development, creative or user experience. 

The chapter is where professional learning, challenge and R&D happens. It’s also where professional line management takes place, including performance coaching and feedback. 

Each chapter has a team member who acts as chapter lead - an experienced professional whose job it is to bring the chapter together and help it thrive.

#Questions and answers about team working

## Who’s in charge of what I do?

You are. 

Our project teams are self-organising teams that include all the people with the skills needed to deliver the kind of projects our clients want. 

We don’t have a management hierarchy because we believe that the best way for a team to work is for team members themselves to work out the best way to hit the team’s goals.

## Who’s my line manager?

Ultimately your line manager is a director (Simon, Tim or Andrew). Your chapter lead approves holiday requests as they are accountable for the delivery capacity of their chapter.

You are accountable for delivering your professional development through our self-development process (also known as OKRs). 

Your chapter lead and the directors are responsible for supporting your professional development. 

Directors look after all other line management functions (such as pay, performance improvement, career progression, sickness, welfare and long-term absence, disciplinary, grievance, and appraisals).
