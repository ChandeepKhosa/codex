# Roles at Deeson.

This page describes the job roles that we have at Deeson. 

First up, a definition before reading this page:

*Job roles* set expectations for the project, client and company, and ensure someone is covering all the different aspects of what we do. Job roles are defined in terms of 'impacts' in a job scorecard – things that a team member does which make a difference to the business. 

In some cases, individuals will perform more than one of the roles on a project. As an individual's career progresses, they are likely to take on more roles. This allows individuals to grow and develop professionally by moving into new areas and working on new skills.

## Shared accountabilities.

Here are the specific accountabilities we all share, regardless of our job title and role on any specific project:

* Client satisfaction.
* Delivering projects (on time, on budget, on spec).
* Your own capacity.
* Your own capability.
* Supporting your colleagues.
* Following company processes.


## Roles and scorecards.

At Deeson, each job role has a job scorecard. This sets out what impact we expect a team member to have in a particular role and is used in 1:1s, impact scoring and professional development planning.
