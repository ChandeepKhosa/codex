#Roles at Deeson

We're not big on job titles at Deeson, but we do think it's important that everyone understands their accountabilities.

When thinking about roles there are two subtly different things that are important:

1. The **job role** that we hire people into the agency to do and they need to fulfil when they’re here
2. The **project roles** that team members play on specific projects when they’re working within a pod

The first is important to set expectations for the company and the new team member. It will inevitably change over time as the agency and the team member develops professionally.

The second reflects the pod being a unique team of individuals and recognises that on different projects, pod team members with different skills will be able to play different roles - and that’s ok.

The first is broader in remit and more fixed than the second, which may flex according to pod and projects. The second is always a sub-set of the first.

##Shared accountabilities

Here are the specific accountabilities we all share regardless of our role:

1. Client satisfaction
2. Delivering projects (on time, on budget, on spec)
3. Your own capacity
4. Your own capability
5. Supporting your colleagues
6. Following company processes

#Technical specialisms

Within roles in the technical chapter, it is important we have the right mix of technical skills to deliver client work. 

To deliver our vision of being Europe’s leading open source agency, our core technology skill areas will need to be (at least):

- Drupal
- WordPress
- HTML
- CSS and CSS preprocessing (SASS)
- ES6 (and future versions)
- Frontend javascript (e.g. Angular, React, Flux)
- Server side javascript (e.g. Node.js)
- PHP frameworks (e.g. Symfony, Laravel)
- Infrastructure

Developers at Deeson join the company with technical skills in at least one of these areas. We expect our developers to be interested and able enough to learn how to work in other areas listed, although we don’t expect everyone to be equally competent in each area. 

Deep specialisms in one or more area are a good thing and are encouraged through our quarterly OKR process.

Solutions Architects need to be able to know enough about all of these areas to be able to do their role effectively, but they’re likely to have deeper specialisms in one or more of these areas too.

There’s not a single desired profile of skills for the developer roles, but we need to make sure that the mix is right across a pod as a whole.
