## Project roles at Deeson

Our project management process is based on the Agile methodology called [DSDM Agile project framework](https://www.agilebusiness.org/content/introduction-0) developed by the Agile Business Consortium. Project roles are distinct sets of responsibilities on a project. An individual on a project may hold one or more of these roles.

The diagram below shows the DSDM 'alien baby' diagram that shows the various project roles.

The roles in the head are project governance roles, those in the body are the team that build and deliver the solution for the project. The roles in the shaded area are supporting the project and are not part of the project team. White roles are Deeson roles and orange roles are client or other external roles.

The project lead acts as oversight on the entire project and is ultimately responsible for its successful delivery.

They ask the hard questions to keep the project team honest and the project on track. They discover the issues that the team struggle to articulate and act as the most senior escalation point on the project team for the client. They have the more senior account level conversations and consultancy with the client.

The project lead provides continuity of leadership and direction throughout the project, starting with Feasibility and staying with the project through Foundations, Development and Launch.
