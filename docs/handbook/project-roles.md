## Project roles at Deeson.

Our project management process is based on the agile methodology called [DSDM Agile project framework](https://www.agilebusiness.org/content/introduction-0) developed by the Agile Business Consortium. Project roles are distinct sets of responsibilities on a project. An individual on a project may hold one or more of these roles.

The diagram below shows the DSDM 'alien baby' diagram that shows the various project roles.

The roles in the head are project governance roles and those in the body comprise the team that builds and delivers the solution for the project. The roles in the shaded area are supporting the project and are not part of the project team. White roles are Deeson roles and orange roles are client or other external roles.
