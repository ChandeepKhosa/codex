#What makes a successful pod?

We know that four things are important for a self-organising pod at Deeson to be successful:

1. **Competency** - team members need to be competent to be able to deliver their accountabilities. This competency leads to confidence in their work and significantly reduces the need for direction that would have come from managers in traditional agency management structures.
2. **Collaboration** - pods work as a motivated and committed team rather than as a group of individuals. 
3. **Trust and respect** - for a team to be effective team members trust and respect each other. They believe in collective ownership of projects for our clients and are ready to go the extra mile to help each other resolve issues.
4. **Continuity** - for a pod team to get to know and trust each other they need to be together for a reasonable duration. Continuity is essential for the team. 

#Our principles for pods

In practice this means we have a few principles that we hold about how pods work that we stick to. 

We only break these self-imposed rules with a discussion with the pod and leadership teams first:

1. A pod must have a user experience consultant, a designer, a front-end developer, a solutions architect, an account manager and at least two developers.
2. A pod has ten members at most. 
3. We don’t share team members across pods.
4. We keep all the same client projects in one pod.
5. We don’t break the “golden thread” of a project by splitting discovery and production across pods.
6. The creative roles within a pod are need to be co-located wherever possible.

# What are the roles in a pod?

It’s really important that we’re all clear what we are accountable for. 

That means it’s important to describe the accountabilities of the different roles that make up a pod. 

Having clear accountabilities doesn’t mean that we won’t work on things that other people are accountable for - for example in a strong football team a striker might drop back to defence if that’s what’s right for the team at that time. 

Above all we succeed and fail as a team in all we do. 

In practice that everyone working in our agency has a set of accountabilities in common as well as some seat specific accountabilities. 

For us to be at the top of our game we need everyone to be great at being where they’re supposed to be and doing what they’re supposed to do. 

Each role within the agency has clear accountabilities. You can read more about those [here] (http://deeson-codex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handbook/roles-at-deeson/).

#Questions and answers about pod working

##Who’s in charge of what I do?

You are. 

Our pods are self-organising teams that include all the people with the skills needed to deliver the kind of projects our clients want. 

We don’t have a management hierarchy because we believe that the best way for a team to work is for team members themselves to work out the best way to hit the team’s goals.

##Who’s my line manager?

Ultimately your line manager is a director (Simon or Andrew). Your pod lead approves holiday requests as they are accountable for the delivery capacity of a pod.

You are accountable for delivering your professional development through our self-development process (also known as OKRs). 

Your chapter lead and the directors are responsible for supporting your professional development. 

Directors look after all other line management functions (such as pay, performance improvement, career progression, sickness, welfare and long-term absence, disciplinary, grievance, and appraisals).

##Who's in which pod?

You can see details of who does what in each pod [here] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g6r1k6JgFNe_4NvvZfSa4ROONzUNWWGMedb-gBHQkkk/edit#heading=h.bwbcgo8uj5ew). 

##Which clients / projects are in each pod?

You can see this in the [project overview list] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RYEHvwX79gxh23FKGeR_bg-FmYY_dCBIOxkCCypTmU4/edit#gid=0).

##How do I know how my pod is doing?

We have a company and pod dashboard that’s available for everyone in the company to see. 

The scorecard is updated at the start of each week and shows the key numbers that show how the company and pod is doing against its goals. 

The company scorecard URL is shared in the #general Slack channel as a pinned item.
