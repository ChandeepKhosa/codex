# The Deeson operating system.

We know that every company needs an operating system. It's how all the different parts of the business fit together and are managed effectively.

Since September 2015, we've been working hard to codify our own company operating system. We now share it in the Deeson Handbook, so that it's transparent and everyone is able to understand how the company is being run.

## Origins.

The first iteration of the Deeson operating system was tightly based on the Gino Wickman's [Entrepreneurial Operating System](http://www.eosworldwide.com/what-is-eos#axzz4U78AHZrp) (EOS). 

It provided a firm basis for establishing a company focus, defining clear roles with accountabilities, and a strategic planning cycle that combined a long-term direction with quarterly goals and weekly progress tracking.

Over time, we have deliberately moved away from a pure implementation of EOS, towards a more bespoke approach that combines EOS with other systems. 

We've done this because EOS didn't fit very comfortably with our model of self-organising project teams. We feel the pure EOS model is better suited to a more hierarchical organisation.

We have adapted the aspects of EOS that work well for us. These include the use of 'rocks' as 90 day goals, effective meeting practices and a strong focus on accountabilities for every role.

More recently, we have also adopted most of the [VMOST agile strategic planning tool](http://www.vmost.tools/). This has helped us ensure we have the right balance of short-, medium- and long-term goals for the agency.
