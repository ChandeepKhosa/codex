# Co-working

If you have a blue The Office Group (TOG) swipe card for the Deeson London office, you can also use other co-working spaces/lounges run by TOG.

You need to present your blue card to get access. If you haven't got a card, you can gain access by explaining that you work for Deeson, which has an office in the Gridiron building in London.

Locations are shown on [The Office Group website](https://www.theofficegroup.co.uk/overview/).
