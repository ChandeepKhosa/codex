#Sabbaticals

Long term team members and long term clients are a great benefit of our approach.

But fresh perspective is really valuable too. That’s why we’re [introducing a paid sabbatical](https://www.deeson.co.uk/blog/weve-introduced-sabbaticals-heres-why) for all permanent employed team members every five years.

In the calendar year when you reach five years of continuous employment with the company you become eligible for a mandatory five week long sabbatical. You’ll then be eligible for a five week sabbatical every five years after that.

That means you take five fully paid weeks off work to help recharge your batteries, get a fresh perspective and maybe do something that’s not achievable in a normal holiday.

The sabbatical is mandatory to ensure team members take time out to refresh themselves.

That provides a good opportunity for other team members to try new things and take on new responsibilities too. It’s definitely not our place to decide what you do with it - you know best.

We'd encourage you to get as far from your everyday routines as you can.

Even if it's just to appreciate them with fresh eyes on your return. The process of packaging up your role and having a different life for a while is healthy for you and for the company.

To make this possible we provide  an extra three weeks paid holiday (15 days) on top of your standard annual holiday allowance of 24 days in the calendar year in which you reach 5/10/15 years with Deeson.

The five weeks must be taken together in one block and you must not have contact with the company during this period (no lurking on Slack!). You can use your remaining holiday allowance at any point during that year as usual.

##How it works

- You are responsible for planning your handover and cover, with the company's support as required. This handover should cover your project and non-project commitments.
- For advance planning of sabbaticals you should get in principle approval from your pod colleagues, chapter lead and the MD before you make any commitments/arrangements (eg travel bookings).
- You need to get detailed plans for this agreed within your pod and approved by your pod and chapter leads at least two months ahead of the start of your sabbatical. The plans then must be signed off by Simon before the sabbatical is formally approved.
- Plan in advance to make sure you allow enough time to ensure your role is properly covered in your absence.
- If you’re already eligible for a sabbatical because you’ve been with the company more than five years, there’s a longer two year transitional period for you to take your sabbatical in - you need to take it between the scheme launch (1 June 2016) and 30 June 2018. For those becoming eligible in 2017, there is an extended 18 month period in which you should take your sabbatical (1 January 2017 to 30 June 2018).
- For future years the sabbatical needs to be taken during the calendar year in which your work anniversary takes place. This period can be extended at the MD’s discretion.

##The small print that we have to say

- Your are eligible for your first sabbatical at five years continuous employment with the company (or immediately if you have already worked at the company for more than five years). You are eligible for subsequent sabbaticals every five years after taking your first sabbatical.
- If you take the sabbatical and then leave the company during your anniversary year you’ll need to pay back the additional leave that you’ve taken above and beyond your standard leave entitlement when you leave.
- The scheme is for permanently employed Deeson team members only. It is not a contractual obligation and the taking of the sabbatical and its timing is ultimately at the company’s discretion.
- To be eligible for the sabbatical you mustn’t have had any disciplinary written or formal warnings in the six months before your sabbatical starts.
- You mustn’t be subject to a short term sickness absence final review or the long term sickness absence procedure in the six months before your sabbatical starts.
- Maternity, paternity or parental leave does not affect your eligibility for this scheme.
- While you’re on sabbatical you remain an employee of the company and all normal contractual conditions still apply.
- It is compulsory to make sure you have a great time on your sabbatical and share your experiences when you return.
