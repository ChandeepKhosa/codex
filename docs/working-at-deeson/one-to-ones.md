#One to ones

Every Deeson team member has a 60 minute one to one with their line manager every month.

While we have a strong culture of direct and timely feedback, the monthly one to one meeting is an opportunity to take a step back from the day-to-day work and discuss what's on your mind.

One to ones deliberately have a structure which involves the team member doing most of the talking. Ideally they will take place in person wherever possible. 

The format was inspired by Buffer's work on one to ones described [here](https://blog.bufferapp.com/a-simple-guide-to-better-coaching-and-feedback-in-your-company).

##Agenda

Every one to one follows a standard agenda:

- 10 minutes to share and celebrate your achievements (shared with company on Slack if appropriate)
- 30 minutes to discuss your current top challenges, progress on any quarterly goal contributions or anything youâ€™d like to add to the goal backlog for next quarter
- 10 minutes for your line manager to share some feedback
- 10 minutes you to give feedback to your line manager

##Notes

Line managers make brief notes of one to one meetings in the *People 1:1s Trello*. These are automatically shared with the *People Managers Slack* channel.
