#Unlimited training budget

The work we do for clients changes rapidly and that means we always need to be investing in our own skills and experiences.

Each Deeson team member has an unlimited training budget that enables them to do this.

The unlimited training budget is managed through our Professional Development Programme (PDP) scheme. 

This is a structured self-reflection process that each team member undertakes annually with their line manager.

It incorporates peer, client and manager feedback to help each team member get a rounded view of their strengths and opportunities for development.

The process also looks at the needs of the team member's current role and their career ambitions as well.

Once the PDP is finalised, each team member is responsible for planning and undertaking the activities set out in their plan for the year.

The range of activities included in PDPs is wide. It cn include things like:

- training courses (online and face to face)
- shadowing
- mentoring
- coaching as coach or coachee
- working on different types of project
- secondment
- professional qualifications
- meet-ups and events
- public speaking
- conferences
- personal study
- reflective practice

There are no limits to what can be considered for inclusion in a PDP - what's important is getting the right mix of activities that will help a team member develop and be deliverable alongside their role at Deeson.
