# Company pension.

All Deeson team members are automatically enrolled into our workplace pension scheme with Legal & General (L&G).
 
You will receive an enrolment notification from L&G when you've been enrolled. This will tell you:

- The date you became a member of the scheme.
- How much you will have to contribute.
- How much the company will contribute.
- Where your money will be invested.

You have the right to opt-out of the company pension scheme if you wish.

Contributions to your pension are currently set at 1% of qualifying earnings for both the employer and employee. 

From April 2018, the employer contribution will be 2% and your contribution will be 3% of your qualifying earnings. 

From April 2019, the employer contribution will be 3% and your contribution will be 5%.
