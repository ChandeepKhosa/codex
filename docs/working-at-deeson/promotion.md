# Promotion and moving roles.

We have a transparent approach to how team members can move between job roles – for example, transitioning from a developer to a senior developer role.

The possibility of moving to a new role is something that should form part of the regular 1:1 and PDP discussions that team members have with their line manager. 

## Qualifying criteria.

To be considered for a move to a new role, the team member must have achieved a rating of at least 2.5 in their last two assessments within their current role, and not have any individual ratings below an A in those two assessments.

If those criteria are met and the line manager agrees that a move to the new role is the right thing to pursue at that time, there will be a six month period where the team member will have the opportunity to 'act up' into the new role, usually alongside their existing role.

## Assessing suitability for promotion.

During this period, we’ll make sure that the team member has opportunities to fulfil the responsibilities of the new role and demonstrate their suitability for a permanent promotion. There will be no change to pay during this period.

Every quarter, they will be assessed against the job scorecard for the new role in parallel with the normal assessment against their current job scorecard.

To be able to move into the new role permanently, they should be assessed with a rating of at least 1.5 in the new role for two consecutive assessments (a period of six months).

## Probationary period after being promoted.

The first six months after being confirmed permanently in the new role should be considered a probationary period. Pay would change to the impact outcome rating of 1.5 in the new role from the start of the probationary period. 

If the team member doesn’t achieve a satisfactory impact rating by the end of the probationary period, we reserve the right to return them back to their previous role and pay immediately or extend the probationary period to provide extra time and support to help them succeed.
