#Strategic planning

We have a 90 day planning process that runs in line with our company's financial year:

- Quarter 1 - October, November and December
- Quarter 2 - January, February and March
- Quarter 3 - April, May and June
- Quarter 4 - July, August and September

Before the start of each quarter we hold an open workshop session that allows any Deeson team member to be part of our strategic planning session.

Our strategic planning covers four areas:

1. Vision - where we want to be as a business in the next 12-18 months
2. Missions - the building blocks of what we need to do to acchieve our vison
3. Objectives - measureable checkpoints that we need to have accomplished to ensure a mission is complete
4. Tactics - the things we are going to do in the next 90 days to deliver an objective

We keep our strategic plan as a set of nested ["to-do" lists in Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/3624440/buckets/2215746/todosets/329262117) that's open for every Deeson team member to see.
