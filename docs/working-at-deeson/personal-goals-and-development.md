#Personal goals and development

We believe that to be able to do their best work, everyone needs clear goals that are linked to the bigger goals that weâ€™ve got as a company as well as personal aspirations and interests.

As an agency we have a longstanding strong commitment to helping team members pursue their personal development goals. 

We're reviewing how we do this as we're not convinced our current approach to managing personal development is working as well as it should.
