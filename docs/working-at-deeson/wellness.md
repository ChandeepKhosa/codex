# Wellness fund.

_This information is for team members employed by Deeson Group Ltd and Deeson Publishing Ltd._

All permanent Deeson employees are entitled to an annual personal £250 [wellness fund](https://www.deeson.co.uk/blog/healthy-mind-healthy-body-new-deeson-wellness-fund), which they can spend on improving their health and wellbeing.

## Two simple guidelines.

-   It should be used on something which you're not already doing.
-   It should be used on activities you spend time doing, rather than the equipment you'll be doing it with.

## Ideas for inspiration.

-   Gym, golf club or swimming/walking/running/yoga club membership.
-   Personal training.
-   Wellness coach assessment/programme.
-   Smoking cessation.
-   Weight loss group.
-   Massage, chiropractor or physiotherapy.
-   Counselling or therapy (e.g. CBT).
-   Mental wellness courses (e.g. stress management, meditation or spiritual).
-   Retreats.
-   Learning new skills (e.g. healthy cooking classes, creative writing, photography, pottery, knitting, learning to play an instrument).

## How to spend your wellness fund.

-   Consult the inspiration list above and choose how you'd like to spend your budget. If you're unsure whether it's an eligible activity, please check with your manager.
-   Pay using a company credit card and upload the receipt to Receipt Bank, or pay from your personal account and claim as a normal expense.
-   We are keeping a record of how the team makes use of the wellness fund, so please let Mel R know what you plan to do and when.
-   It would be great to share what you did and what benefits you felt, so please share a short write up with the team on Slack afterwards.

## Small print.

- The wellness fund is £250 per calendar year. 
- In a team member's first year with the company, the fund is available on a pro rata basis.
