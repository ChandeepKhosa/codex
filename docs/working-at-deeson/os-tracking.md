#Tracking our progress

It's really important we keep track of our progress in delivering our vision, mission, objectives and tactics.

We have a regular cycle of review meetings that are designed to identify and resolve blockers to progress.

##Project review

Weekly one hour reviews of project status with each project lead and the MD. Also attended by the agile project manager.

The agenda is:

1. Review of actions from previous week
2. Review of Harvest/Forecast/client feedback/project reporting
3. Issues arising per project
4. Log actions for the next week (who, when)

The actions/issues for each project lead are [here](https://3.basecamp.com/3624440/buckets/2223195/todosets/330220463).

##Delivery meeting

One hour meeting each week attended by all project leads, chapter leads and the directors. Covers any other cross-agency delivery issues that aren't specific to a particular project.

This meeting also reviews progress ("on track" / "off track") on our vision, mission, objectives and tactics. Where there are blockers that can't be sorted outside the meeting, this is when we identify them, discuss them and most important solve them.

The agenda is:

1. Sharing personal and business "bests" for the past week
2. Review of operations dashboard
3. Sharing client and team headlines
4. Review of actions from previous week
5. Review of progress on objectives / tactics
6. Issue resolution - I-D-S
7. Recap actions / cascading messages / meeting rating (1-10)

##People

We know that we can only deliver our vision if all Deeson team members are working at their best for our clients. 

The fortnightly one hour people meeting is where we review how our team members are doing and what support is needed to help them be the best they can be at work.

The meeting is attended by the chapter leads and directors.

##Operations

This is a monthly one hour meeting attended by the directors and the finance manager. The purpose is to have oversight of all finance, operations and infrastructure activities.

The actions/issues for this meeting are [here](https://3.basecamp.com/3624440/buckets/2215746/todolists/329263244).
