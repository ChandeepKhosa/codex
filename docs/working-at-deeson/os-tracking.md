# Tracking our progress.

It's really important that we keep track of our progress in delivering our vision, mission, objectives and tactics.

We have a regular cycle of review meetings that are designed to identify and resolve blockers to progress.

## Project reviews.

Weekly, one hour reviews of a project's status with each Project Lead and the MD. The review is also attended by the Agile Project Manager.

The agenda is:

1. Review of actions from the previous week.
2. Review of Harvest/Forecast/client feedback/project reporting.
3. Issues arising per project.
4. Log actions for the next week (who, when).

The actions/issues for each Project Lead are [here](https://3.basecamp.com/3624440/buckets/2223195/todosets/330220463).

## Delivery meeting.

A one hour meeting each week that is attended by all Project Leads, Chapter Leads and the Directors. Covers any other cross-agency delivery issues that aren't specific to a particular project.

This meeting also reviews progress ('on track'/'off track') of our vision, mission, objectives and tactics. If there are blockers that can't be sorted outside the meeting, this is when we can identify, discuss and most importantly, solve them.

The agenda is:

1. Sharing personal and business 'bests' for the past week.
2. Review of operations dashboard.
3. Sharing client and team headlines.
4. Review of actions from the previous week.
5. Review of progress on objectives/tactics.
6. Issue resolution â€“ I-D-S.
7. Recap actions/cascading messages/meeting rating (1-10).

## People.

We know that we can only deliver our vision if all Deeson team members are working at their best for our clients. 

The fortnightly, one hour people meeting is where we review how our team members are doing and what support is needed to help them be the best they can be at work.

The meeting is attended by the Chapter Leads and Directors.

## Operations.

This is a monthly, one hour meeting attended by the Directors and the Finance Manager. The purpose is to have oversight of all finance, operations and infrastructure activities.

The actions/issues for this meeting are [here](https://3.basecamp.com/3624440/buckets/2215746/todolists/329263244).
