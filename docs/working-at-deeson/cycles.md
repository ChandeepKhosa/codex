# Tax-free cycles and e-cycles

As a Deeson employee, you can save 25-39% on the cost of a new bike or e-bike through a salary sacrifice scheme.

This means that the cost of paying for the new bike is spread over an extended period. The deduction is made from your gross salary, so you make income tax and national insurance savings.

If you want to purchase a bike or e-bike using this benefit, please check out the details below and then speak to Hannah to get the paperwork sorted out. You need to do this before committing to purchase the bike from a retailer.

At Deeson we provide this benefit using two partners:

## Cyclescheme

Cyclescheme works with more than 2,000 local and online retailers. You can find out more about a tax-free bike and accessories through Cyclescheme [here](https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/). 

There is a limit of £1,000 for bikes and accessories supplied through Cyclescheme.

## Green Commute Initiative

The Green Commute Initiative (GCI) is a not for profit social enterprise, with a mission to get more commuters out of their cars and onto clean e-bikes because cleaner air helps us all.

GCI works with e-bike retailers nationwide to supply e-bikes. There is no £1,000 limit on e-bike salary sacrifice schemes managed through GCI.
