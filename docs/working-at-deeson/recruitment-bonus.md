#Recruitment bonus

As a fast growth technology business we’re always looking for more great people to join our team. You can see more about our recruitment [here](https://www.deeson.co.uk/careers).

We know that our existing team members often know people who would be a great fit for what we do. 

That’s why we have our recruitment bonus. 

We pay a bonus of £2,000 to say thank you to current team members who do something beyond the scope of their everyday job that leads to a new team member accepting a permanent position with us. 

A referral is defined as:

>When you do something beyond the scope of your everyday job that leads to the candidate applying for a relevant role and subsequently being successful in their application, e.g. contacting a member of your existing network or meeting someone at a conference and inviting them to apply.

All you need to do to claim the bonus is let the chapter lead know who you’re introducing. The candidate will go through our normal recruitment process and if they’re successful, we’ll pay the £2,000 when they start with the company. 

Remember the bonus is paid along with your normal salary and is subject to tax and National Insurance deductions.

For referrals where more than one team member claims the bonus, you’ll need to agree how to split the bonus among yourselves. 

Remember the bonus isn’t payable when a candidate contacts us directly as a result of any of our existing recruitment marketing - it’s about helping us meet people we wouldn’t have otherwise met.
