## Conference calls

If everyone is online then Google Hangouts is a good choice for a conference call. This can be started from a slack channel using the command /hangout or from [phttps://plus.google.com/hangouts](https://plus.google.com/hangouts). An alternative is [appear.in](http://appear.in) which is a good fallback option.

There are Jabra microphone/speakers in the pod rooms, G1 and G2. They give better audio quality than the built-in Mac microphones so please use them.

There is a conference phone in G1 and G2. If only one person or telephone is remote then everyone should go into one of these rooms and use the conference phone there to call them.

If you have several remote parties all needing to dial into a call then you can use the telephone conference call software called PowWowNow:

1. Sign up for a web account from [https://www.powwownow.co.uk](https://www.powwownow.co.uk)
2. Once logged in you can then download and install the desktop application locally from  [https://www.powwownow.co.uk/myPwn/Web-Conferencing](https://www.powwownow.co.uk/myPwn/Web-Conferencing)
3. Run the application after installing, under Schedule a Meeting, it will give you a premium rate telephone number to dial and a conference pin code. Share both these with the other members of the conference call.
4. The desktop application also allows you to share your screen

PowWowNow costs money for each caller to call so only use it if everyone is distributed. If there is just one person remote then it is better to call that one person direct from the conference telephones in G1 or G2 or use hangouts.

For now, it is possible to call the PowWowNow number for free from Google Hangouts please use this instead of the UK number as itâ€™s expensive. Before the hangout starts you are asked if you would like to invite others to join the hangout. One option is to invite a telephone. Use the US telephone number for PowWowNow: 14153630833. You use the same pin number to join the channel as your PowWowNow application gives you.
