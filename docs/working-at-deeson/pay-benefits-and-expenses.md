#Tools, purchasing and equipment

**I really need Widget X to work from home better? Why haven’t we experimented with Tech Y already?**

The company provides a laptop and core software. In company offices we also provide things like keyboards, screens, internet access and stationery.

But most of us also have extra tools we need to be able to do our work efficiently. That might be a bit of kit to use with your Mac, some specialist software or some hardware you want to experiment with. 

The company provides a budget of up to £500 to each team member each year to spend at their discretion on anything that helps them do their job at Deeson better. 

What you spend that on is up to you - spend the money like it was your own. But don’t just spend it because it’s there - money is obviously a valuable resource we’ve all worked hard for.

No-one pre-approves what you spend it on. Be prepared to share the resource with your colleagues if need be.

To use your allowance, buy the item/service/thing, add it to the [tool list](https://docs.google.com/a/deeson.co.uk/spreadsheets/d/1jOTBKmHVrgcQGbvAVt8ta7c1UtK7pZeAhwgr6auuCfo/edit?usp=drive_web) and add to ReceiptBank for approval. Where possible get someone with a company card to make the payment, although you can buy it on a personal credit card and be reimbursed by BACS.

**How do I purchase equipment for the office, print for a client etc?**

Purchases by credit card are sent through ReceiptBank for approval. Purchases that are paid for later or that require a purchase order are entered via Xero only. Nothing needs to be added in both places.

**Does this include pens / paper / maracas / iPads?**

The company will supply printers, toner and printer paper. 

Beyond that you should buy what you need using your budget and look after it, this includes consumables such as notepads.
What if I run out of budget?

If you’ve used it effectively and you need more then you’ll get more.

**Who’s responsible for looking after what I buy?**

You. Buying resources at a company level is really inefficient - they often get lost or no one knows where they are when they need them, so they get bought again and again. 

Or we lose expensive things like iPads before a pitch because it’s everyone’s and no-one’s responsibility to look after them.

This is a waste of time searching for it, money buying it and bad for the environment - 100 AA batteries of unknown charge in a drawer is a fail.

**The small print**

Anything you buy remains company property. 

You need to take good care of it and if you leave you need to return it along with other company kit. 

If you’re using it for non-work purposes and you break it then you need to replace it at your cost.

There’s an open list of who’s got/bought what so that everyone can share. The onus is on you to check that we aren’t buying small amounts inefficiently, to get the best deal and that we don’t already have five Segways in the cellar.

#Pay and expenses

**Any rules of thumb for expenses?**

Yes, some simple ones:

- spend it was like it was your own
- use the most effective form of travel considering the environment, convenience, time and cost

If you’re working away from your normal working location (Canterbury, London or home), it’s ok to claim for reasonable food and subsistence expenses.

**How do I claim expenses?**

Expenses can be paid either on a company credit card or paid using your own cash or card and then reimbursed to you. Repayments will be made by BACS within 21 days.

All expenses should have an accompanying supporting document and must be uploaded to Receipt Bank. Where they can be billed to a project please indicate this in the notes field before submitting.

Acceptable supporting documents include:
- A simplified receipt for transactions under £250 e.g. Tesco/Starbucks
- A VAT invoice from the supplier (this will show an invoice number, invoice date, supplier’s trading name & address, supplier’s VAT number, our company name & a description of the goods/services provided)

Supporting documents that aren't acceptable include:
- Email confirmation
- Delivery notes
- Remittance advices
- Supplier statements
- Card copy receipt
- Letters
- Paypal receipts (please obtain the supplier invoice)

If expense receipts are lost or the incorrect supporting document is uploaded, we can't reclaim the VAT on the purchase.

Please try to upload documents to Receipt Bank as soon as possible after you've spent the money. If in doubt, just ask Hannah! 

Purchases of equipment and supplies are handled differently, see the Tool section.

**If I go by car?**

Then you should ideally hire one for insurance and cost reasons. 

If there’s a reason not to and you’ve got appropriate commercial use insurance then mileage for cars and motorcycles is paid at [HMRC standard rates](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-business-travel-mileage/rules-for-tax). 

To claim mileage complete a copy of this [form](https://docs.google.com/a/deeson.co.uk/document/d/1hCzjEty61qrAFGcvBO5fMh_CCT_QLNYB9wg9mageAp8/edit?usp=drive_web) and submit a PDF to ReceiptBank.

**When does my salary get paid?**

On or around the first working day of each month.

##Recruitment bonus

We’re always looking for more great people to join our team. You can see more about our recruitment [here](https://www.deeson.co.uk/careers).

And we know that our existing team members often know people who would be a great fit for what we do. 

That’s why we have our recruitment bonus. 

We pay a bonus of £2,000 to say thank you to current team members who do something beyond the scope of their everyday job that leads to a new team member accepting a permanent position with us. 

A referral is defined as:

>When you do something beyond the scope of your everyday job that leads to the candidate applying for a relevant role and subsequently being successful in their application, e.g. contacting a member of your existing network or meeting someone at a conference and inviting them to apply.

All you need to do to claim the bonus is let the recruitment lead know who you’re introducing. The candidate will go through our normal recruitment process and if they’re successful, we’ll pay the £2,000 when they start with the company. 

Remember the bonus is paid along with your normal salary and is subject to tax and National Insurance deductions.

For referrals where more than one team member claims the bonus, you’ll need to agree how to split the bonus among yourselves. 

The £2,000 bonus is effective for candidates first introduced after Monday 13 June 2016. For candidates first introduced before this date the bonus payable is £750.

Remember the bonus isn’t payable when a candidate contacts us directly as a result of any of our existing recruitment marketing - it’s about helping us meet people we wouldn’t have otherwise met.
