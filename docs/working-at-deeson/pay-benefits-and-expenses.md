#Pay, benefits, expenses and recruitment bonus

#Pay

Salaries are paid by BACS directly into your nominated bank account on or close to the first of every month.

If you change your bank details, please let Hannah S know at least three weeks before the next pay day so that she can make sure your pay ends up in the right place.

#Benefits

All permanent employees get an annual £250 Wellness Fund which they can spend on improving their health and wellbeing.

Our guidelines on this are

- it should be used on something which you're not already doing
- it should be used on activities you spend time doing, rather than the equipment you'll be doing it with

They’ll also get an unlimited training budget, and a budget of up to £500 to spend each year on anything that helps to do their job at Deeson better.

If a permanent team member has been with Deeson for five years, they’ll get a five week paid sabbatical. This is mandatory, so they’ll need to focus on the challenge of making it happen, rather than postponing it.

#Expenses

Reasonable expenses incurred whilst visiting clients, attending meetings, attending events & carrying out training will be reimbursed by Deeson.

Our guidelines are:

- spend it like it was your own
- the company pays if it’s a cost you wouldn’t otherwise have incurred 
- use the most efficient form of travel considering the environment, convenience, time and cost

##How do I reclaim expenses?

Expenses can be paid either on a company credit card or paid using your own cash or card and then reimbursed to you. Repayments will be made by BACS within 21 days.

All expense claims must be supported by a valid VAT receipt or invoice to allow us to process the payment and reclaim the VAT on your purchase. A VAT receipt will show:

- an invoice number
- invoice date
- supplier’s trading name & address
- supplier’s VAT number
- our company name 
- a description of the goods/services provided)

A simplified receipt for transactions under £250 e.g. Tesco/Starbucks is acceptable. 

The receipt or invoice should be uploaded to Receipt Bank, detailing what the expense relates to if it’s not clear. 

Supporting documents that aren't acceptable include: 

- Email confirmation 
- Delivery notes 
- Remittance advices 
- Supplier statements 
- Card copy receipt 
- Letters 
- Paypal receipts (please obtain the supplier invoice)

##Recharging expenses to clients

Any travel or expenses incurred when visiting clients outside of London should be recharged to that specific project when claiming.

All you need to do is upload the receipt to Receipt Bank as normal and make sure you indicate that the expense is rechargeable and the client it relates to in the notes field before submitting.  

##Travel

The most effective form of travel considering the environment, convenience, time and cost should be used.

###Air and rail

Air and rail fares should be booked as far in advance as possible to secure the cheapest rates and should be made in standard/economy class. If you make multiple UK journeys by train in a year, a Network Railcard can be purchased if cost effective.

If any travel booking is going to cost over £200 then authorisation from a Director should be obtained before proceeding. 

You should own and use a Network Railcard if you regularly travel to London. It should be used both ways for an off peak journey. If you need to travel from Canterbury to London at peak time, you should buy a single peak ticket for the journey to London and a separate off-peak return with Network Railcard for the journey back.

###Taxi

When possible, you should use public transport. However taxi fares will be reimbursed if it would be more cost effective or use of public transport would be considered unreasonable (late night journeys etc).

###Cars and bikes

Ideally a car should be hired for insurance and cost reasons. 

If there’s a reason not to and you’ve got appropriate commercial use insurance then mileage for cars and motorcycles is paid at HMRC standard rates:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Type of vehicle</td>
    <td>First 10,000 miles</td>
    <td>Above 10,000 miles</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cars and vans</td>
    <td>45p</td>
    <td>25p</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Motorcycles</td>
    <td>24p</td>
    <td>24p</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bikes</td>
    <td>20p</td>
    <td>20p</td>
  </tr>
</table>


###Car parking

Car parking costs can be claimed as expenses where relevant. Car parking at Canterbury station should not normally be claimed, unless there’s a good reason why you need to park at the station rather than the office car park.

##Accommodation

If Deeson requires you to travel to a different location to work for longer than one day (normally outside of Canterbury & London) and travel time would be unreasonable, you can book overnight accommodation. Employees should be mindful of cost, location and travel times when booking a hotel. 

If you need help, Melanie Richards will be able to do this for you - [melanier@deeson.co.uk](mailto:melanier@deeson.co.uk). The company has business accounts with some hotel chains.

##Subsistence

You can claim for meals while staying overnight, travelling for business before 7am or after 8pm and are away from the office for more than half a day. Alcoholic drinks aren’t included within subsistence and can’t be claimed. 

We don’t have specific limits for subsistence costs as the cost depends so much on location, but please remember the "spend it like it was your own" guideline and be sensible.

If you have to work at a location that isn’t your usual one (home, Canterbury or London) it’s not normally OK to claim for lunch. 

If you would normally pop out and buy yourself lunch and a coffee when at your regular location, then it’s not a claimable expense as you would have paid for lunch anyway.

 
The exception to this is if you’d normally have a packed lunch but being somewhere else means it’s not practical to do what you’d normally do. In that situation buying lunch is an expense you wouldn’t otherwise have incurred so it’s OK to claim. 

Again, please remember your judgement is important here to avoid us needing to have stricter expense guidelines.

Drinks, coffees and food when travelling between Canterbury and London (or vice versa) shouldn’t be claimed as expenses.

##Entertaining

###Company entertaining

Entertaining is when we spend money to entertain people who don’t work for Deeson (clients, prospects etc) and is used for one of three purposes:

1. To discuss a particular Deeson project or potential project

2. To maintain an existing Deeson relationship 

3. To form a new business connection.

All entertainment claims must include a business reason and the name and company of all attendees – even those who work for Deeson. This ensures we comply with the UK Bribery Act and also helps us apply the right VAT treatment. 

Amounts claimed should be reasonable and appropriate.

###Staff entertaining

Expenses incurred when entertaining other Deeson members of staff are not normally reimbursable. 

The exception to this is where a Director, pod lead or chapter lead decides it is appropriate for the company to pay for entertaining staff. The cost of this can be claimed - for example to pay for a pod lunch or team building activity. If you want to spend more than £100 on this please discuss with the MD beforehand.

Any other expenses entertaining staff members would be classed as a personal expense and could not be reclaimed.


#Recruitment bonus

We’re always looking for more great people to join our team. You can see more about our recruitment [here](https://www.deeson.co.uk/careers).

And we know that our existing team members often know people who would be a great fit for what we do. 

That’s why we have our recruitment bonus. 

We pay a bonus of £2,000 to say thank you to current team members who do something beyond the scope of their everyday job that leads to a new team member accepting a permanent position with us. 

A referral is defined as:

>When you do something beyond the scope of your everyday job that leads to the candidate applying for a relevant role and subsequently being successful in their application, e.g. contacting a member of your existing network or meeting someone at a conference and inviting them to apply.

All you need to do to claim the bonus is let the recruitment lead know who you’re introducing. The candidate will go through our normal recruitment process and if they’re successful, we’ll pay the £2,000 when they start with the company. 

Remember the bonus is paid along with your normal salary and is subject to tax and National Insurance deductions.

For referrals where more than one team member claims the bonus, you’ll need to agree how to split the bonus among yourselves. 

The £2,000 bonus is effective for candidates first introduced after Monday 13 June 2016. For candidates first introduced before this date the bonus payable is £750.

Remember the bonus isn’t payable when a candidate contacts us directly as a result of any of our existing recruitment marketing - it’s about helping us meet people we wouldn’t have otherwise met.
