#Pay

We want everyone to be paid fairly and sustainably for their work at Deeson. We want how pay is set and changed to be as transparent as possible. 

In January 2018, following more than four months of consultation and detailed research we launched our transparent pay scheme.

##Principles

The pay scheme was designed to fit with a number of principles for how pay is worked out at Deeson:

Our pay and reward scheme is designed to:

- Support our aim to build a long-term, stable, diverse and high performing team
- Balance financial and non-financial benefits for team members
- Be competitive to attract and retain team members who value working at Deeson
- Be non-negotiable so pay and reward is independent of an individual’s personal negotiation and influencing skills
- Be open and transparent within the agency and outside the agency
- Have a published pay scale linked to each role (defined by job scorecards)
- Ensure the business remains sustainable through transparency of the costs to the company of pay and other forms of reward
- Reflect the core role a team member has and any additional responsibilities they have within the agency
- Be based on measurable factors as far as possible
- Be as location-independent as possible but recognise that’s not always possible
- More closely reflect the relationship between the impact of roles and the company’s overall performance
- Provide a clear and fair process for review of pay for existing team members

##Our current pay scales

The pay scales for roles at Deeson are below:

- [Pay scales - 1/2/2018 to 30/9/2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19dbyHOX29yLpNrK3KsywY9CKYXsCSKYm/view?usp=sharing)

The scales are reviewed every September as part of our annual budget setting for the financial year (1 October to 30 September). 

The evidence base that we have used to look at the external market for potentially comparable roles is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11CT5g_p4aFzeL5XPckNks_nTAxTrJipliOvFRv8TZ-k/edit#gid=452421314). 

Team members can add evidence, such as job adverts, articles or salary surveys, that they see to this sheet so it will be included in the next review of pay scales. To add evidence just send it to Simon via Slack at any time.

##How we link impact and pay

The basics of our scheme are explained below:

- Every role has a job scorecard that sets out what we expect team members to achieve in their role
- Every quarter in 1:1 meetings Deeson team members have an assessment of the impact you’re having against the outcomes in the job scorecard. This is what we’re calling an impact rating.
- Each year in October we set pay scales for each role for the finncial year ahead - based on transparent evidence from a range of sources. 
- We also make sure that the pay scales are affordable for the business by setting pay scales alongside our budget planning every financial year and ensuring our total budgeted costs for pay don’t exceed the industry benchmark.
- We have a transparent way that pay is reviewed and increased in line with performance in a role - based on impact ratings over three consecutive assessments.
- We have a transparent way that team members can progress into new roles and be rewarded accordingly.
- We have a transparent and non-negotiable approach to pay setting for new recruits to the Deeson team.
- We have a “fair pay guarantee” that rewards team members if the business does better than we expected it to when we set the pay scales for that year.
- We have a clear guidelines for transitioning to the new pay arrangements for existing team members as at January 2018

##Getting a pay review

In this section we explain how the impact score links to changes in pay for a team member within their current role (ie not being promoted to a different role).

Our secondary research has shown that “single point in time” performance assessments that are directly linked to changes in pay can be counter-productive. We want to ensure that sustained improvements in impact score are recognised in pay progression.

Pay progression up the pay scale will based on the **average of the last three impact scores**. The first impact score will be recorded in April in 2018 and then every quarter thereafter.

To qualify for a pay review your average impact score over the past three assessments should relate to a salary on the scale that is greater than your current salary. You must also not have any impact outcomes marked as X (not enough evidence) during the past three assessments.

During this review we would consider the average impact score, overall billability achieved during the past nine months and any other relevant factors (for example if significant time has been spent on R&D activities during the period which has meant billability targets have not been met). 

This review is undertaken by a director and chapter lead. It happens within 21 days of the request being made. Subsequent changes to pay in line with the pay scale and average impact score are back-dated to the date of the review request being made.

If a team member is paid more than their average impact score then they will not be entitled to ask for a pay review. 

If a team member is subject to a company disciplinary process, has received any form of disciplinary warning/sanction in the past six months or is subject to formal performance management procedures, they will not be entitled to ask for a pay review.

This will be a rolling process, so there will be four opportunities per year where a team member could ask for a pay review based on their average impact outcome score over the past nine months. 

There will be a limit of one pay increase per financial year per team member. This limit does not apply to team members in the junior roles within the team. 

We believe this approach is better than a traditional annual pay review process where performance related pay progression can only happen at the traditional annual appraisal that we don’t have at Deeson.
