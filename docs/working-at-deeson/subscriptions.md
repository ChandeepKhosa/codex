## Subscriptions

As we grow we need to keep track of the many software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscriptions we have across the team. If we won’t do this we’ve found that we end up paying for unused subscriptions or for the wrong number of users. This costs the company more than it needs to and that’s a bad thing.

That’s why we say that all subscriptions must be paid for on a Chapter Lead or Director’s company credit card. 

If you wish to take out a subscription or feel the company could benefit from a particular service, speak with the appropriate card holder and they can arrange for the payment to be set up.
