# Employee social media policy.

_This policy applies to team members employed by Deeson Group Ltd and Deeson Publishing Ltd._

## Overview.

**If you wouldn’t say it in front of your boss or a client, then don’t say it on public social media.**

The lines between work and personal life can become blurred.

Each individual is personally responsible for the content he or she publishes on any form of social media.

You may have identified yourself as a Deeson employee or identified the company as your employer, either directly or as part of a user profile.

If so, ensure your profile and related content is consistent with how you wish to present yourself to the company’s clients, business contacts and your colleagues. Please be aware that any inappropriate postings may reflect badly on the company and/or the people you work with.

## Share information carefully.

Social media is just that – social. It is intended to be seen and interacted with by a broad range of people.

It is natural to let people know where you work but employees should be careful not to reveal any information that is confidential, either about the company’s business or clients.

The same applies to revealing information about your colleagues. They trust you to be discreet about information that you may know about them or their lives, in or outside work.
