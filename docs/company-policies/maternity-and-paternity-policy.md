- This allowance applies to each of your children but can only be taken in blocks of up to 4 weeks per year.

##Leaving Deeson after maternity, adoption or paternity leave

Given our commitment to building a long-term, stable, diverse and high performing team, Deeson has chosen to put in place a policy that pays well above the statutory minimum during maternity, adoption and paternity. 

This means we do require team members to return to work following maternity, adoption and paternity for a set period to remain eligible for the enhanced pay they have received.

If you leave Deeson following your return to work from a period of maternity, adoption or paternity leave and have received pay above the statutory minimum, you will have to repay the enhanced pay as set out below:

###Leaving within 6 months of your return to work

If your final day of employment with Deeson is within six months of your return to work date after a period of maternity, adoption or paternity leave, the full enhanced maternity / adoption / paternity benefits above the statutory minimum would be repayable in full.

###Leaving within 6 and 12 months of your return to work

If your final day of employment with Deeson is between six and twelve months of your return to work date after a period of maternity, adoption or paternity leave, 50% of the enhanced maternity / adoption / paternity benefits above the statutory minimum would be repayable in full.

###Leaving more than 12 months after your reutrn to work

If your final day of employment with Deeson is more than twelve months after your return to work date after a period of maternity, adoption or paternity leave, there will be no repayment due.

## Am I entitled to share maternity / adoption leave and pay with my partner?

Shared parental leave is designed to give parents / adopters more flexibility in how to share the care of their child in the first year following birth or adoption. 
If you are eligible you can share up to 50 weeks leave, and can decide to be off work at the same time and/or take it in turns to have periods of leave to look after the child. To be eligible you must meet the following criteria:

- You (or your partner) must be entitled to maternity / adoption leave, or statutory maternity / adoption pay (or maternity allowance from the Government) and you must share the main responsibility for caring for the child with your partner. 
- In addition, you and your partner will also be required to follow a two-step process to establish eligibility as follows:

**Step 1 - Continuity test:** If you are seeking to take shared parental leave, one parent / adopter must have worked for the same employer for at least 26 weeks at the end of the 15th week before the week in which the child is due (or at the week in which an adopter was notified of having been matched with a child or adoption) and they should still be employed in the first week that shared parental leave is to be taken.

The other parent /adopter has to have worked for 26 weeks in the 66 weeks leading up to the due date and have earned above the maternity allowance threshold of Â£30 a week in 13 of the 66 weeks.

**Step 2 - Individual eligibility for pay:** To qualify for shared parental pay the parent / main adopter must, as well as passing the Continuity test, also have earned an average salary of the National Insurance lower earnings limit or more for the 8 weeks prior to the 15th week before the expected birth / adoption.

Although the situation around pregnancy and adoption appears complex, it is normally quite straightforward to work out your entitlement. Therefore as soon as you know you are pregnant or have been matched with a child for adoption, please let us know as soon as is practical. We will calculate your entitlement and the relevant dates for you.
