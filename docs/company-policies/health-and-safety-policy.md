# Health and safety policy

The company believes in the active prevention of accidents and ill health, and it is its policy to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of its employees. The company will, to this end, endeavour to keep up-to-date with current professional expertise on health and safety matters, and to observe all relevant statutes, regulations and codes of practice. 

The company recognises its duties to persons other than employees and it is its policy to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the health and safety of visitors is not put at risk by its operations. Particular attention is paid to the provision and maintenance of: 

- Plant, equipment and systems of work that are safe and without risk. 

- Sufficient information to enable all employees to avoid hazards and contribute positively to their own health and safety at work. 

- A working environment which is safe and without risk to health, and with safe access to and exit from it. 


The company reminds its employees of their own duties, under Section 7 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, to take care of their own health and safety and that of other persons who may be affected by acts or omissions at work, and to co-operate with the company in meeting its responsibilities. 

The premises are inspected regularly. All passages and gangways should be kept clear of obstructions, including trailing wires. All electric cables should be checked from time-to-time to ensure they are safe. Care should be taken on all staircases, especially those to the top floor, which are very steep. 

Never lift beyond your capability and avoid strains.
