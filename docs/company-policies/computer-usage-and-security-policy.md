# Computer usage and security policy

## Mandated security practices to follow:

1. FileVault (whole disk encryption) must be enabled on all devices.

2. You must have a password on screensaver / sleep (not more than 15 mins).

3. You must keep operating system and application updates current. For major OS upgrades please wait until the company has tested the upgrade and notified all team members before proceeding.

4. Don’t install software that might compromise network or computer security.

5. You must have long and unique passwords for each online account. These must be stored in the approved company password management system (Lastpass) only.

6. You must not change either the primary user or the administrator account passwords on your company-supplied laptop.

7. Your primary user account (the one that you use to work from) must not have been set to default to administrator / root privileges.

8. Keep your laptop as physically secure as you would your wallet.

9. A passcode must be set on all mobile devices including personal devices with access to company data, eg iPads, iPhones, smartphones.

10. You must not transfer or copy any company or client data to personal devices. The only exception of this is the use of personally owned mobile devices in line with this policy.

11. You must complete the monthly IT self-assesment checklist: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZBjz9jYl5sqNLzsO4WJjST_r5g-La7UZ8XI2UG8Umf0/edit#gid=0

## Full Guidelines

1. For consistency, all staff must use a company provided MacOS based laptop as their primary machine for work. You must not replace the operating system on your machine.

2. Use of the internet by employees is permitted and encouraged where such use is appropriate for business purposes and supports the goals and objectives of Deeson Group Ltd.

3. The Employee Social Media Policy must be adhered to.

4. You must not use the Internet or company network for any illegal activity, including unauthorised access to other computer systems, or attempts at such unauthorised access. Attempts to cause failure of a machine are regarded as unauthorised access.

5. If you have been given an email or other access account, you must take reasonable steps to keep your password or other access token secure. There will be a presumption that actions carried out with your account were authorised by you.

6. The use of our network for the sending of unsolicited commercial email is strictly prohibited.

7. Company-provided resources, such as internet and network connections, email privileges, laptops and mobile devices are intended to be used for business purposes and reasonable personal usage only. Employees should be aware that usage is monitored for unusual activity.

8. No attempt is made to monitor individual communications; however correspondence via email is not guaranteed to be private. Use of the Internet/Intranet and email may be subject to monitoring for security and/or network management reasons.

9. Communications of a sensitive or confidential nature should not be sent unless they are encrypted. It should be made clear to recipients that opinions expressed by individuals are not necessarily those of the Company.

## Returning equipment

When returning equipment, for example if you are leaving Deeson, you should not remove any company data from it. This means that neither your laptop nor backup disk should be erased, including previous versions from your backup disk.

The company will archive data on all staff machines after they are no longer in use for a period of at least one month before data is destroyed. We will only access this data in line with our full guidelines above.
