We're an agency called Deeson. You can find out more about us over on our website at [http://www.deeson.co.uk/](www.deeson.co.uk).

Our mission is to become Europe’s leading open source agency

And we’re well on our way.

It’s not just technology that we think differently about, we're thinking about the future of work too. 

We’ve re-designed our company structure and how we work together.

We're open by design. 

That's why our team handbook, processes and information is all published here under a Creative Commons license.

If you like the sound of the way we do things, we're always looking for new team members based in London, Canterbury or anywhere in Europe. You can find out more about working for Deeson on our [careers page](https://www.deeson.co.uk/careers).
