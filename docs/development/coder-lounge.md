Coder Lounge is our monthly tech meetup where we eat Pizza, discuss tech and work on interesting personal projects
individually and in teams. 

This currently happens at our offices in Canterbury on the last Wednesday of the month from 3 PM until 9 PM.

If you want to get into community development then ask someone for something to do here. The 
[Group module](https://drupal.org/project/group) issue queue always has things to work on!
