## Creating a board

A project can have 1 or more boards which are used to organise the
tasks.

In the simple case, you will have a single board on the project
which contains all the issues in the project.

In the more complex case, you can separate the issues onto different
project boards. This is useful, for example, if you have several
concurrent projects for the same client or need to manage both a
project as well as ongoing maintenance work to the live site.
