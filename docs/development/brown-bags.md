Brownbags happen on a Thursday lunchtime 13:15 PM - 14:00 PM UK time. We broadcast these via Google Hangouts so
remote people can participate. Every developer is expected to contribute to brown bags at some point discussing
recent project work, recent community projects, new modules or just something cool they found and want to demo to the
team. 

We have a standing rule not to heckle you on your first Brown Bag.
