1. Having common standards / a house style / agreed convention, keeps our work consistent across projects.
2. There are many **right** ways to do something but if several people do 3 different right things the result is a mess. 
3. We are all professionals, its possible to justify a deviation from convention where appropriate, just consider carefully when doing so.
4. Repeated deviation means its becoming an exception and we need a discussion to decide if it should be changed.
5. We value **convention over configuration**. Too many choices mean we spend too long thinking about the stuff that doesn't matter. A convention defines the boring stuff so what is left is the interesting stuff that makes a project different.

## Guidelines

1. Feel free to add or alter anything, it is all in version control after all.
2. If you are adding something not yet defined then make a pull request and post a link on #developers slack channel for opinions.
3. If you are altering the documentation then its polite to ask around beforehand if it might cause alarm. Again, a pull request is a good way to demo the changes.
4. We value strong opinions, lightly held. Don't be a jerk, its helpful to reach a consensus but if the weight of opinion is against you, please accept it and move on.
5. If in doubt, create a pull request.
