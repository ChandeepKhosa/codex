When handing over work to a client we need to make sure we communicate everything they are going to need to accept the
work you have done as complete.

You should use your good judgement to ensure the right level of detail and instruction. If you are unsure if you
communication will be understood, check with a colleague before sending.

Here are some **important** things to consider:

1. Repeat what you were asked to do and describe how it is complete
2. Provide links to examples on the UAT environment where they can be viewed
3. Provide instructions on the process of using the functionality
4. The UAT environment is probably protected with _basic authentication_ so remember to include the access details along
   with the instructions every time to save them just asking for them. Its nice to add this in the URLs like this:
   https://username:password@uat.env.com/path/to/example
5. Don't assume the client will work it out, you'll lose more time later when they feedback a bunch of questions which
   could have been answered before hand with some simple instructions
   
### Acceptance criteria approach

One good way of handing over a finished story is to list the acceptance criteria and then put a note under each
including links. This neatly ties your finished work back to what was originally asked for in an unambiguous manner.

### Screen cast tutorial approach

Another way to approach the handover is to do a screen cast of yourself using the new feature.
[QuickCast](http://quickcast.io/) is a Mac OSX app which makes this very simple to do. Be aware that when you publish
the screen cast it'll accessible to anyone with the link so don't do this if the client or work is security sensitive.
