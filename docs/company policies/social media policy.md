# Employee social media policy

## Overview

**If you wouldn’t say it in front of your boss and clients then don’t say it on social media that clients or colleagues can see.**

Use of social media, blogging and other online tools is commonplace. This document is intended to provide Deeson Group staff with guidelines to eliminate any confusion concerning the use of social media and its relationship with their employment.

The lines between work and personal life can become blurred. What you do on your own time is a personal decision. However, activities in or outside of work that affect your job performance, the performance of others, or Deeson Group business interests may affect the company and your colleagues.

Each individual is personally responsible for the content he or she publishes on any form of social media.

You may have identified yourself as a Deeson Group employee or identified the company as your employer, either directly or as part of a user profile.

If so, ensure your profile and related content is consistent with how you wish to present yourself to the the company’s clients, business contacts, and your colleagues. Please be aware that any inappropriate postings may reflect badly on the company and/or the people you work with.

## Share information carefully

Social media is just that – social. It is intended to be seen and interacted with by a broad range of people.

Despite privacy settings, most posts through social media are visible by anyone with online access. It is, of course, fine to let people know where you work but employees do not have permission to reveal any information that is confidential, either about the company’s business or clients.

The same applies to revealing information about your colleagues. They trust you to be discreet about information that you may know about them or their lives, in or outside work.

## Guidelines

* Use common sense. Don’t do anything stupid. You should refrain from posting items that could reflect negatively on the company or otherwise embarrass the organisation.

* Don’t use off-colour or sexual humor, ethnic slurs, personal insults, obscenity, or engage in any conduct that would not be acceptable in the office.

* Show respect for people’s privacy and for topics that may be considered objectionable or inflammatory, like politics and religion.

* Respect the law, including those laws governing defamation, discrimination, harassment, and copyright and fair use.

* Don’t disclose the company’s or clients’ confidential or other proprietary information, such as current or anticipated products, software, research, inventions, processes, techniques, designs, or other data. Many of our clients have non-disclosure agreements with the company. They ask that we do not reveal any part of our business relationship with them, which sometimes even includes the fact that we work for them at all.
